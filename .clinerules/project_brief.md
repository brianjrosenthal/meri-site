### Project Brief
This folder is merimadon.com "Rites of Passage".  The purpose of the web site is to be the business web page for a business owned by my friend Meredith Madon who helps people overcome experiences of trauma through a number of different healing services:

(a) Rites of Passage
(b) Cranio-Sacral Therapy
(c) Somatic-Emotional Release
(d) Shamanic Work
(e) Reiki

### CMS

The content management system is something called "get-simple cms".  It's a file-based content management system with themes.

### Theme
The theme that it is using is "ResponsiveCE" (/theme/ResponsiveCE), and in that directory can be found most of the HTML / CSS for the site.

### Editing this site.
When possible, please preserve the structure of the cms.  In other words, please make it where you have the header and footer with the theme.  The content is pulled from the content.  The homepage should be in HTML (not escaped HTML), and you can see an example of how that works in theme/ResponsiveCE/homepage-content.html.
