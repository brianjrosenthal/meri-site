<p>Core Shamanism, developed by Dr. Michael Harner, is a modern approach to ancient Shamanic wisdom – a pathway that bridges traditional spiritual practices and contemporary life. Rooted in the universal and near universal principles found in indigenous, shamanic traditions around the world, core shamanism teaches how to safely and respectfully access the realms of spirit for healing guidance and personal transformation. Through rhythmic, drumming, focused intention and shamanic journeying we develop our resilience, inner power and a sense of wholeness.</p>

<h3>Meri's Approach</h3>
<p>Meri has developed a method of introducing clients to the shamanic journeying process through a practical and deeply meaningful step by step approach. Such approach is accessible privately and in a group format. Once the skillset of the shamanic journey is mastered, clients who are interested will receive gentle guidance and powerful support as they delve into core shamanic healing.</p>

<p>While some Shamanic work utilizes plant medicine, a requirement of my practice and core shamanism is that we explore without any mind altering substances.</p>
