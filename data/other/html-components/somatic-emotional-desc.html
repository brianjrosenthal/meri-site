<p>SomatoEmotional Release (SER) invites the release of the residual effects of trauma and stress stored in the body. During a session gentle guidance is provided through therapeutic touch, dialogue, and guided imagery to release physical and emotional tension stored in the body. Clients are invited to build resilience through deepening connection with their inner self. We offer the opportunity to incorporate ancient shamanic work to build resilience as we move through trauma in SER work.</p>
