<h3>Ceremony</h3>
<p>We pass through many of our life's transitions without properly honoring them. Moving through our moments of transformation leaves us feeling confused, empty and overwhelmed. Our lives can feel anti-climactic and critical moments not meaningfully incorporated into our inner tapestry.</p>

<p>We will work with you to create meaningful ceremony for the important transformations in your life. We create ceremony around transitions such as:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Traumatic Events (Working through and releasing)</li>
    <li>Entering or exiting a relationship</li>
    <li>Releasing parts of oneself that no longer serves</li>
    <li>Adopting or accepting parts of oneself</li>
    <li>Gender affirming transitions</li>
    <li>Personal, quiet acceptance or coming out of the closet as an LGBTQIA+ Person</li>
    <li>Moving into or leaving a home</li>
    <li>Miscarriage and Abortion</li>
    <li>Onset of Menses and Menopause</li>
    <li>Transformation of someone you love who is no longer in your life (Death / Marriage / Birth of Child)</li>
    <li>Adoption or loss of a pet</li>
    <li>Accepting your child's, parents, siblings, spouses, loved ones transitions, feelings, choices</li>
</ul>
