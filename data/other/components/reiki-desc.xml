    <value><![CDATA[<p>Reiki is a gentle, holistic healing practice that originated in Japan. The word Reiki comes from the Japanese words, "Rei", meaning universal and "Ki" meaning life energy. Reiki works by channeling this universal energy through the practitioners, hands to promote balance, relaxation and healing in the body mind and spirit. This energy based therapy encourages the natural flow of life force within, helping to reduce stress, relieve tension and support overall well-being. In our practice Reiki is incorporated into cranio sacral therapy work when appropriate.</p>]]></value>
