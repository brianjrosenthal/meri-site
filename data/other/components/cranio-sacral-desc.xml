    <value><![CDATA[<p>Cranio Sacral Therapy is a gentle, hands on method of touch which enables the body to relax and self correct. Delicate manual techniques focused on the cranial bones, sacral bones and the cranio sacral fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord to facilitate the release of restrictions throughout the body.</p>

<p>Our practice may incorporate Dynamic Body Balancing which encourages Myofascial Unwinding which aims to release tension and improve flexibility in the fascia, the connective tissue that surrounds and supports muscles, organs and bones. A cranio sacral session is performed fully clothed on a massage table.</p>]]></value>
