<p>Meredith (Meri) served as a lawyer for students with special needs from 2005-2024. During her work she found that cranio sacral therapy, SomatoEmotion release and shamanic work was a surprisingly effective and efficient way of healing emotional trauma and calming the nervous system. Having a background working the children with special needs she decided to study the healing modalities.</p>
