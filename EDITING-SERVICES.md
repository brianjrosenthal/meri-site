# How to Edit Service Descriptions

The service descriptions on the homepage are now editable through the GetSimple admin panel!

## Steps to Edit a Service Description:

1. **Login to Admin Panel**
   - Go to: `yoursite.com/admin/`
   - Enter your username and password

2. **Navigate to Components**
   - Click on "Components" in the sidebar menu

3. **Find the Service You Want to Edit**
   You'll see these components:
   - **Rites of Passage Description** (`rites-of-passage-desc`)
   - **Cranio-Sacral Therapy Description** (`cranio-sacral-desc`)
   - **Somatic-Emotional Release Description** (`somatic-emotional-desc`)
   - **Shamanic Work Description** (`shamanic-work-desc`)
   - **Dynamic Body Balancing Description** (`dynamic-body-desc`)
   - **Reiki Description** (`reiki-desc`)

4. **Click "Edit" on the Component**
   - Click the "Edit" button next to the service you want to change

5. **Update the Content**
   - Edit the text in the editor
   - You can:
     - Add or remove paragraphs
     - Create bullet lists
     - Add headings (like "Meri's Approach")
     - Format text (bold, italic, etc.)

6. **Save Your Changes**
   - Click the "Save" button
   - Your changes will immediately appear on the homepage!

## Tips:

- **Preview First**: After saving, visit your homepage to see how it looks
- **Backup**: The admin automatically creates backups, but you can also copy the text before making major changes
- **Formatting**: Use the WYSIWYG editor toolbar to format your text
- **HTML Knowledge Not Required**: The editor works like a word processor

## What CAN'T Be Edited Here:

- Service titles (the h2 headings like "Rites of Passage")
- The order of services
- Service images in the grid

These require editing the template files. Contact Brian if you need to change these.
